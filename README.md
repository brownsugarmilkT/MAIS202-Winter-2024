## stockr.ai Stock Prices Fetching Tool
by Samaksh Khandewal and Marcus DelaCruz

## What is it?
stockr.ai is a machine learning based stock predictor for S&P 500 stocks (as long as the stock has been public for atleast the last 9 years). stockr.ai can approximate the close price for the next 30 days of any given stock.

## How to use?
download the webapp folder as found in our github. open your command terminal/powershell and change directories to where the folder is stored (typically downloads until you move it). install the required libraries using

```
pip install Flask numpy yfinance tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
```

then finally run the webapp using 

```
python app.py
```

## BONUS
we have a python-jupyter notebook to better visualize the machine learning process and code that went into making this all possible! just download it from the repo and run on your favourite IDE!
